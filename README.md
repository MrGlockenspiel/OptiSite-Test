# MrGlockenspiel's OptiSite Test

My own version of the OptiSite. This is entirely just to show my ideas, JackDotJS did all the real work. Expect broken things, ESPECIALLY on the donate page. The dark mode toggle does not save which theme you pick and will default to light mode every time you refresh or go to a new page. I don't care enough to fix that, it's just a proof-of-concept and again, to show my ideas.<br><br>
